        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious.<br> Garlic noodles were invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long.<br> Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.<br></p>

            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat.<br> Add garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute.<br> Quickly stir in the secret sauce and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br> Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet slightly firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer spaghetti into the sauce using tongs, bringing some of the cooking water with it.<br> Toss until well coated; stir in Parmesan cheese.<br> Splash in more pasta water if noodles are too dry.</li>
